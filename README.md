Flight Booking App

This is a basic Angular project I created to practice and understand core Angular concepts like routing, lazy loading, services, and form validation. It simulates a simple flight booking system where users can log in, browse available flights, and add them to a cart.

## Features

- Login page using reactive forms with validation
- Flight list (products) with dynamic routing to detail pages
- Route parameter handling using ActivatedRoute
- Cart page to simulate selected bookings
- Lazy-loaded modules for better performance
- Custom validator examples

## How to Run

Make sure Node.js and Angular CLI are installed.

Install Angular CLI globally:

npm install -g @angular/cli

## Purpose of This Project

This project was made to understand:

- How Angular components and modules are structured
- Navigation and dynamic routing
- Form handling and validation
- Creating and injecting services
- Optimizing with lazy loading
